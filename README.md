# Martian Travel Tube System


### Mission:
Our goal is to realise the fastest lead times possible:

By lead time we are referring to the speed at which goods can be delivered to their destination after placing an order. The speed at which a good is ordered and the delivery of it is, through our innovative system, unprecedented.

We are also referring to the efficiency of transporting humans to their desired / required location. Decreasing traveltime enriches human lives. Response time to emergency situations is drastically lowered. This allows our own emergency task force to respond quickly to infrastructural emergencies. All other emergency services also benefit from this, increasing safety by a large margin.



### Vision:
Through an easily accessible network of travel tubes we want to 
allow goods and people to travel more efficiently than ever.



### Concept:

We provide a fast, safe, reliable, fun and fully automatic travel system for dome inhabitants and companies. By offering the fastest way of transportation, it grants people less travel time, which translates to more sleep, freetime and worry free lives. For companies we offer a separate tubular network with larger pods to guarantee fast deliveries on large shipments.
